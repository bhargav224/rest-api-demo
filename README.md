# rest-api-demo

## API which take any string as input and return all permutations of String (Logical) are done. you can access it using below url:
     - http://localhost:8080/mvcspring/user/permutation/{input_here}
     
Using Hibernate database created but table not created .I tried but its not working and because of that I was not able to complete logic and repository layer for other APIs.
